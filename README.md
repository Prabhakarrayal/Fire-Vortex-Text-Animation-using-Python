# 🔥 Fire Vortex Text Animation using Python (Pygame)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **Python-based visual animation system** that creates a cinematic **fire effect** for any user-entered text.

The animation includes a **fire vortex intro**, **glowing fire text formation**, **heatwave distortion**, **smoke simulation**, and a **full fire explosion outro**.

The main objective of this project is to understand how **particle systems, physics-based motion, and real-time rendering** are used in modern animations and game engines.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Pygame
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Program
```bash
python animation.py
```

### 3️⃣ Enter Text
* When prompted, enter any word or name you want to animate.

## 🎬 Animation Flow

1. Particles start from the outside in a circular fire vortex

2. Particles move towards the text shape and form glowing fire text

3. Heatwave and smoke effects enhance realism

4. Final fire explosion outro with ash dissolve
